				<p>We first met on January 2nd, 2010. A mutual friend gave Lauren&#8217;s phone number to Scott encouraging him to call her. They set up a blind date to go see Sherlock Holmes at Opry Mills.</p>
<p>Scott: <em>I remember standing in front of the box office, excited to meet this girl I&#8217;d only talked to on the phone, worried because we&#8217;d never met and I wouldn&#8217;t know who she is in a crowd. This is why on blind dates a man holds a red rose. I remember getting out my phone and sending her a text message: &#8220;brown hair, blue jacket&#8221;.</em></p>
<p>Lauren: <em>I remember being very nervous and worrying about what to wear.  I was concerned about what we would talk about and if there would be any awkward moments.  My sister assured me that Scott was super easy to talk to and that there would be no pressure.  He sent me the text, I walked up to him, we introduced ourselves, and he said &#8220;wanna go see a movie?&#8221;.</em></p>
<p><img src="/uploads/01.jpg" width="300" height="300" />&nbsp;<img src="/uploads/02.jpg" width="300" height="300" />&nbsp;<img src="/uploads/03.jpg" width="300" height="300" /></p>
<p>Scott: <em>Date #2 was dinner at Chuy&#8217;s on Elvis&#8217; birthday. Date #11 we learned how to play backgammon together. Date #14 I introduced her to all my friends at a Superbowl party. Date #21 She introduced me to all her work friends. We trained together for the Country Music Half Marathon and we kept pace with each other during the race despite the pouring rain. Somewhere in there I fell in love. Hard.</em></p>
<p>Lauren:  <em>There is one weekend in particular that really stands out for me.  We had been out to eat with Joel and Carrie and came back to Scott&#8217;s house.  After they left, we were hanging out and I started having this terrible pain in my side.  I was concerned that it might be my appendix, so Scott insisted that he drive me back to my house because I was in so much pain and he knew that my mom was worried about me too.  He stayed the night planning to go back home the next day.  I woke up feeling much better, I woke him, and we went to breakfast with Mom at IHOP.  It was pouring down rain.  I thought for sure the rain would stop, but it just didn&#8217;t.  We figured we&#8217;d fix dinner and stay in because of all the rain, but the electricity was out for several hours.  It was flooding!  I know Scott had to be worried because the news kept showing Bellevue under water, but he did a good job of hiding it.  I know he would&#8217;ve done it all again, because that&#8217;s just how he is.  Even though his house could&#8217;ve been flooding, he stayed with me and made sure that I was okay.  It only confirmed just how much I love him. </em></p>

<p>One night in June, they had their evening plans of going to a Nashville Sounds doubleheader rained out. So they decided to stay in, have tacos for dinner &amp; watch The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers. They stayed up late talking about the future and he popped the question.</p>
<p>Scott: <em>We had been engagement ring shopping together, but I figured I had the element of surprise on my side. We were talking about what plans we wanted for our future and I looked at her reassuringly and said &#8220;I&#8217;m not going anywhere&#8221;. She put her hands on my shoulders and looked at me sternly and lovingly, “You better not go anywhere.” At that moment, it felt like popping the question was just a natural progression of the conversation. So I grabbed the ring and proposed. Thank heaven I&#8217;d been practicing the proposal for the last couple of days, or I would have been extra-nervous.</em></p>
<p>Lauren: <em>I just happened to have a very rare middle-of-the-week day off, so we spent the whole day together.  It started raining pretty hard, so we decided that the game would either be rained out or a mess to sit through, so we just headed back to my house for dinner.  I made tacos and we watched some Lord of the Rings.  The air conditioning wasn&#8217;t working upstairs, so we went downstairs because Scott was about to leave.  We had been engagement ring shopping, but I certainly didn&#8217;t think he had the ring yet!  We were talking about us and our future together, and he proposed at the absolute perfect time.  Here I was sweaty with my hair thrown in a ponytail, no make-up, and already crying because of our conversation and he pulls out the ring and says &#8220;speaking of not going anywhere&#8230;I love you.  I want to spend the rest of my life with you.  Lauren, will you marry me?&#8221;.  I just cried, said yes, and he put the ring on my finger.  It was perfect. </em></p>
<p>On April 16th, 2011 at 6pm they will be married at Wightman Chapel in Nashville, TN with family and friends in attendance.</p>
