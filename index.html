    <p>My name is Scott Johnson. I was born in California and for the most part I grew up in Tennessee. I've lived in Louisville KY and Seattle WA, each for a time, but the Nashville area is home. This is where I met my wife Lauren (we got married in 2011), we have lots of family nearby, we've built a house, and it's where we want to raise our kids.</p>
    
    <p>I am a Site Reliability Engineer for Deloitte. It's an individual contributor role that is primarily DevOps work, along with change management, application support, and a little bit of infrastructure architecture work. I'm a subject matter expert on a few applications (some on-prem, some hosted in Azure) and I spend a lot of time writing PowerShell scripts. I used to work for Take Care Health (now called Premise Health), which was owned by Walgreens at the time. That was more of a Technical Analyst role on an implementation team, where I did site migrations and upgrades and worked pretty closely with our software vendors. I've been doing SRE / DevOps / Systems Analyst work since 2007.</p>
